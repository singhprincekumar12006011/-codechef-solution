1)Write a Java class called Person with instance variables name and age. Implement a parameterized constructor that accepts values for name and age and initializes the instance variables.
Create an object of the Person class and display the name and age of the person.




2)Create a class called Rectangle with instance variables length and width. Implement a parameterized constructor that accepts values for length and width and initializes the instance variables.
Add a method called calculateArea() that calculates and returns the area of the rectangle. Create an object of the Rectangle class and display its area.




3)Create a class called Employee with instance variables name, employeeId, and salary. Implement a parameterized constructor that accepts values for name, employeeId, and salary and initializes 
the instance variables. Create an array of Employee objects, initialize them using the constructor, and display the details of all the employees.





4)Create a class called BankAccount with instance variables accountNumber, accountHolderName, and balance. Implement a parameterized constructor that accepts values for accountNumber and 
accountHolderName and initializes the instance variables. Overload the constructor to include an additional parameter for balance and initialize it. Create an object of the BankAccount class
and display the account details.





5)Create a class called Book with instance variables title, author, and year. Implement a parameterized constructor that accepts values for title, author, and year and initializes the 
instance variables. Create an array of Book objects and initialize them using the constructor. Display the details of all the books in the array.





6)Create a class called Student with instance variables name, rollNumber, and grade. Implement a default constructor that initializes the instance variables with default values. Overload the 
constructor to accept values for name, rollNumber, and grade and initialize the instance variables. Create an object of the Student class using both constructors and display the student details.





7)Create a class called Car with instance variables brand, model, and year. Implement a parameterized constructor that accepts values for brand, model, and year and initializes the instance 
variables. Implement a copy constructor that creates a new Car object by copying the values from an existing Car object. Create two Car objects using the parameterized constructor and the copy constructor, and display their details.





8)Create a class called Person with instance variables name and age. Implement a parameterized constructor that accepts values for name and age and initializes the instance variables.
Implement a static method called compareAges() that takes two Person objects as parameters and compares their ages. The method should return the name of the person with the greater 
age. Create two Person objects, compare their ages using the compareAges() method, and display the result.
